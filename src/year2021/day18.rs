//! # Snailfish
//!
//! The key observation is that snailfish numbers represent
//! [binary trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree).
//!
//! For example the first four sample numbers on the problem description look like the following
//! in binary tree form:
//!
//! ```text
//! [1,2]    [[1,2],3]    [9,[8,7]]    [[1,9],[8,5]]
//!   ■          ■            ■              ■
//!  / \        / \          / \           /   \
//! 1   2      ■   3        9   ■         ■     ■
//!           / \              / \       / \   / \
//!          1   2            8   7     1   9 8   5
//! ```
//!
//! The addition rules have an important consequence. Exploding removes two leaf nodes at depth 5
//! and moves them to neighbouring nodes. Since exploding repeatedly happens before splitting until
//! there are no more values at depth 5 this means that the tree will never exceed a depth of 5.
//!
//! Each level of a tree can contain up to 2ⁿ nodes, so the maximum size of a snailfish tree is
//! 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 2⁶-1 = 63 nodes.
//!
//! This means that we can store each snailfish number as an implicit data structure in a fixed size
//! array. This is faster, smaller and more convenient than using a traditional struct with pointers.
//! The root node is stored at index 0. For a node at index `i` its left child is at index
//! `2i + 1`, right child at index `2i + 2` and parent at index `i / 2`. As leaf nodes are
//! always greater than or equal to zero, `-1` is used as a special sentinel value for non-leaf nodes.
