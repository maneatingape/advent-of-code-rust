//! # Amphipod
//!
//! Our high level approach is an [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) search
//! over all possible burrow states. Three techniques are used to speed things up.
//!
//! Firstly a good choice of heuristic is crucial. The heuristic used has the following
//! characteristics:
//! * Exactly correct for optimal moves.
//! * Cheap to update on each subsequent move.
//!
//! Secondly pruning states to reduce the search space is very beneficial. Two approaches are used:
//! * A cache of previously seen states. If amphipods are in the same position but with a higher
//!   cost then the current state will never be optimal and can be pruned.
//! * Detecting deadlocked states where an amphipod in the hallway prevents any possible solution.
//!   Exploring any further is a waste of time.
//!
//! Thirdly low level bit manipulation is used to represent the burrow state size compactly
//! in only 16 bytes for faster copying and hashing.
