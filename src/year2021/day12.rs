//! # Passage Pathing
//!
//! Our basic approach is a [DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) through the cave
//! system, exploring all possible permutations of the paths and finishing whenever we reach
//! the `end` cave.
//!
//! To speed things up, 2 strategies are used, one high level and one low level:
//! * [Memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) (or caching) of the possible paths
//!   from each position, taking into account previously visited caves is the high level strategy
//!   to re-use work and save time.
//! * [Bit Manipulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_manipulation) to store both the graph of
//!   cave connections as an [adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix)
//!   and the list of visited caves compressed into a single `u32` is the low level strategy to
//!   quickly and efficiently store the small cardinality set of caves.

/// Parse the input into an adjency matrix of edges compressed into `u32` bitfields.
///
/// First, each cave is assigned a unique index, with `0` reserved for the `start` cave and `1`
/// reserved for the `end` cave. For example the sample input caves are:
///
/// | start | end | A | b | c | d |
/// | :---: | :-: | - | - | - | - |
/// |   0   |  1  | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
///
/// Next a `vec` of `u32` with an entry for each cave at the corresponding index is created with
/// a bit set for each other cave reachable at `2^n` where n is the cave index. The start cave
/// can only be visited once at the beginning, so it is removed from all edges.
/// For example the sample start cave `vec` looks like:
///
/// | cave  | index | edges  |
/// | ----- | ----- | ------ |
/// | start | 0     |   1100 |
/// | end   | 1     |   1100 |
/// | A     | 2     |  11010 |
/// | b     | 3     | 100110 |
/// | c     | 4     |    100 |
/// | d     | 5     |   1000 |
///
/// Finally all small caves are added to a single `u32`, for example the
/// sample data looks like `111011`.
