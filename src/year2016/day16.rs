//! # Dragon Checksum
//!
//! We solve efficiently with a key insight that the checksum is simply the
//! [odd parity bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_bit) for each block. If the total number
//! of ones is even then the result is one, if the total is odd then the result is zero.
//!
//! This means that only the *total number of ones is important* not the pattern itself. Each
//! checksum bit is computed over the largest power of two divisible into the output size. For part
//! one this is 2⁴ or 16 and for part this is 2²¹ or 2097152. If we can calculate the number of
//! ones for any arbitrary length then we can find the number at the start and end of each block,
//! subtract from each other to get the total in the range then find the checksum bit.
//!
//! We find the number of ones for a pattern of length `n` in `log(n)` complexity as follows:
//! * Start with a known pattern `abcde` and let the reversed bit inverse of this pattern be
//!   `EDCBA`.
//! * Calculate the [prefix sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum) of the known sequence.
//! * If the requested length is within the known sequence (in this example from 0 to 5 inclusive)
//!   then we're done, return the number of ones directly.
//! * Else after one repetition this becomes `abcde0EDCBA`.
//! * If the length is at or to the right of the middle `0`,
//!   for example `length` is 8 then the number of ones is:
//!    * Let `half` = 5 the length of the left hand known sequence.
//!    * Let `full` = 11 the length of the entire sequence.
//!    * Ones in `abcde` => x
//!    * Ones in `EDCBA` => the number of zeroes in `abcde`
//!      => 5 - x => half - x
//!    * Ones in `abc` => y
//!    * Ones in `CBA` => the number of zeroes in `abc`
//!      => 3 - y => 11 - 8 - y => full - length - y => next - y
//!    * The total number of ones in `abcde0ED` is
//!      x + (half - x) - (next - y) => half - next + y
//!
//! Now for the really neat part. We can recursively find the number of ones in `y` by repeating
//! the same process by setting the new `length` to `next`. We keep recursing until the length
//! is less the size of the initial input and we can lookup the final count from the prefix sum.
