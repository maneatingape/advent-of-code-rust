//! # Security Through Obscurity
//!
//! We can quickly eliminate decoys without needing an expensive sort by checking that the
//! frequency of checksum letters is non-increasing, letters of equal frequency are in alphabetical
//! order and that there are no intervening letters in between any two frequencies.
//!
//! In part two as the [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) does
//! not change the length of words, we can also eliminate most candidates with a simple length
//! check and only decrypt a much smaller number of strings.
