//! # Monkey Market
//!
//! Solves both parts simultaneously, parallelizing the work over multiple threads since
//! each secret number is independent. The process of generating the next secret number is a
//! [linear feedback shift register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register).
//! with a cycle of 2²⁴.
//!
//! Interestingly this means that with some clever math it's possible to generate the `n`th number
//! from any starting secret number with only 24 calculations. Unfortunately this doesn't help for
//! part two since we need to check every possible price change. However to speed things up we can
//! make several optimizations:
//!
//! * First the sequence of 4 prices is converted from -9..9 to a base 19 index of 0..19.
//! * Whether a monkey has seen a sequence before and the total bananas for each sequence are
//!   stored in an array. This is much faster than a `HashMap`. Using base 19 gives much better
//!   cache locality needing only 130321 elements, for example compared to shifting each new cost
//!   by 5 bits and storing in an array of 2²⁰ = 1048675 elements. Multiplication on modern
//!   processors is cheap (and several instructions can issue at once) but random memory access
//!   is expensive.
//!
//! A SIMD variant processes 8 hashes at a time, taking about 60% of the time of the scalar version.
//! The bottleneck is that disjoint indices must be written in sequence reducing the amount of work
//! that can be parallelized.
