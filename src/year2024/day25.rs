//! # Code Chronicle
//!
//! Efficiently checks if locks and keys overlap using bitwise logic. The ASCII character
//! `#` (35) is odd and `.` (46) is even so bitwise AND with 1 results in either 1 or 0.
//! The newline character `\n` (10) is even so will result in 0 and not contribute to matches.
//! There are 25 bits plus 4 newline bits so each lock or key can be stored in an `u32`.
//! For example:
//!
//! ```none
//!    #####
//!    ##.##    11011
//!    .#.##    01011
//!    ...## => 00011 => 110110_010110_000110_000100_00010
//!    ...#.    00010
//!    ...#.    00010
//!    .....
//! ```
