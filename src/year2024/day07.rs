//! # Bridge Repair
//!
//! The equations can be validated using a recursive solution that checks all possible combinations
//! of operators. However the number of states to check grows exponentially as 2ⁿ in part one
//! and 3ⁿ in part two.
//!
//! As much faster approach works in reverse from the end of the equation to prune as many states
//! as possible by checking which operations are possible. For example:
//!
//! ```none
//!     Test Value: 123456
//!     Equation: 2 617 56
//!     Addition is possible as 123456 >= 56
//!     Multiplication is not possible as 56 is not a factor of 123456
//!     Concatenation is possible as 1234 || 56 = 123456
//! ```
//!
//! Following the concatenation branch and applying an inverse concentation
//! (the full solution would also follow the addition branch):
//!
//! ```none
//!     Test Value: 1234
//!     Equation: 2 617
//!     Addition is possible as 1234 >= 617
//!     Multiplication is possible as 2 * 617 = 1234
//!     Concatenation is not possible as 1234 does not end in 617
//! ```
//!
//! Following the multiplication branch:
//!
//! ```none
//!     Test Value: 2
//!     Equation: 2
//! ```
//!
//! The test value is equal to the last term which means that the equation is valid.
//!
//! Inverse concenation can be implemented without time consuming conversion to or from
//! strings by dividing the left term by the next power of ten greater than the right term.
//! For example:
//!
//! * 7 || 9 => 79 => 79 / 10 => 7
//! * 12 || 34 => 1234 => 1234 / 100 => 12
//! * 123 || 789 => 123789 => 123789 / 1000 => 123
