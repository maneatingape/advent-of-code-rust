//! # Warehouse Woes
//!
//! Festive version of [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban).
//!
//! Part one loops in a straight line looking for the next space `.` or wall `#`. No bounds checks
//! are needed as the maze is enclosed. If a space is found then all items are pushed one block
//! in that direction.
//!
//! Part two re-uses the part one logic for horizontal moves. Vertical moves use a
//! [breadth first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) to identify the
//! cascading boxes that need to be moved. Boxes are added strictly left to right to make checking
//! for previously added boxes easier. To prevent adding a box twice we check that the
//! item at `index - 2` is different. For example:
//!
//! ```none
//!     @          Indices:
//!     []         23
//!    [][]       4567
//!     []         89
//! ```
//!
//! When processing 6 we try to add 8, however 8 and 9 have already been added when processing 4
//! so we skip.
//!
//! If any next space is a wall then we cancel the entire move and return right away. Otherwise
//! all boxes are moved in the *reverse* order that they were found by the search.
