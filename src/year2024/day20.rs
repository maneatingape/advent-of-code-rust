//! # Race Condition
//!
//! Examining the input shows that there is only a single path from start to finish with
//! no branches. This simplifies checking for shortcuts as any empty space will be on the shortest
//! path from start to end. The cheating rules allow us to "warp" up to `n` squares away to any
//! empty space as measured by [manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry).
//!
//! For part one this is a distance of 2. When checking surrounding squares we make 2 optimizations:
//!
//! * Don't check any squares only 1 away as we can always just move to these normally.
//! * Checking from point `p => q` is always the negative of `q => p`, e.g if `p = 30, q = 50` then
//!   `p => q = 20` and `q => p = -20`. This means we only ever need to check any pair once.
//! * Additionally we only need to check down and right. Previous rows and columns will already
//!   have checked points above and to the left when we reach an empty square.
//!
//! ```none
//!       #         .
//!      ###       ...
//!     ##P## =>  ....#
//!      ###       ...
//!       #         #
//! ```
//!
//! For part two the distance is increased to 20 and the shape now resembles a wonky diamond.
//! This shape ensures complete coverage without duplicating checks.
