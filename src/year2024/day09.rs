//! ## Part One
//!
//! Computes the checksum by simultaneously scanning forward for free blocks and
//! backward for files. No memory is allocated which makes it very fast.
//!
//! ## Part Two
//!
//! We build 10 [min heaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)) in an array to
//! store the free space offsets. The index of the array implicitly stores the size of the
//! free block. The heaps are implemented as a simple reversed `vec`. Usually items are added
//! directly to the top of the heap, so this is faster than a real heap.
//!
//! When moving a file to a free block, the corresponding heap is popped and then any leftover
//! space is pushed back to the heap at a smaller index. The heap at index zero is not used
//! but makes the indexing easier.
