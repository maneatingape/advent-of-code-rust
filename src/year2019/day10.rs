//! # Monitoring Station
//!
//! Integer only solution, avoiding floating point or trignometric lookups such as [`atan2`].
//!
//! ## Part One
//!
//! We compare each pair of points, first subtracting the current asteroid to get a relative vector.
//! Since all coordinates are integers we can check for multiple points on the same line by
//! reducing the vector by its [greatest common divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor).
//! For example, looking from the origin `(0, 0)`, the points `(3, 5)`, `(6, 10)` and `(21, 35)`
//! are all on the same line, with gcds of 1, 2 and 7 respectively.
//!
//! For each point we build a set of previously seen values. Since we can see at most one asteroid
//! in a given direction, if a vector is already in the set then we ignore it. The final size of
//! the set is the number of visible asteroids.
//!
//! To speeds things up a little, we rely on the fact that if asteroid `a` can see `b`, then `b`
//! can see `a`. The solution is still `O(n²)` complexity but we reduce the work by half. This
//! works by implicitly processing asteroids in the same order as the input, from left to right and
//! top to bottom, so that nearest asteroids are always encountered first.
//!
//! ## Part Two
//!
//! The key insight is that we only need the *relative* angle between two vectors to sort them
//! in clockwise order. The [vector cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product)
//! of `a` and `b` can be defined as `|a||b|sinθ` where `θ` is the angle between the vectors.
//! `θ` will be negative if anti-clockwise, zero if on the same line or positive if clockwise.
//!
//! This works for angles up to 90°. To handle the complete 360° rotation, we first order points
//! by [quadrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrant_(plane_geometry)) then by relative angle.
//!
//! Finally we also order points from nearest to furthest, so that the total ordering is:
//! 1. Quadrant
//! 2. Clockwise angle
//! 3. Distance
//!
//! This results in a something like (where letters indicate angle and numbers indicate distance):
//!
//! `a1 a2 a3 b1 c1 c2 c3 c4 d1 d2`
//!
//! We want to process asteroids in the order:
//!
//! `a1 b1 c1 d1 a2 c2 d2 a3 c3 c4`
//!
//! We do this by first numbering the position within each group, then numbering the group and
//! sorting a second time in this order.
