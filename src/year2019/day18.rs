//! # Many-Worlds Interpretation
//!
//! Our high level approach is to simplify the problem into graph path finding. We only
//! ever need to move directly from key to key, so the maze becomes a graph where the nodes are
//! keys and the edge weight is the distance between keys. Doors modify which edges
//! are connected depending on the keys currently possessed.
//!
//! We first find the distance between every pair of keys then run
//! [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) to find the
//! shortest path that visits every node in the graph.

//! The maze is also constructed in such a way to make our life easier:
//! * There is only ever one possible path to each key. We do not need to consider
//!   paths of different lengths that need different keys.
//! * As a corollary, if key `b` lies between `a` and `c` then `|ac| = |ab| + |bc|`. This
//!   enables a huge optimization that we only need to consider immediate neighbours.
//!   If we do not possess key `b` then it never makes sense to skip from `a` to `c` since `b` is
//!   along the way. We can model this by treating keys the same as doors. This optimization
//!   sped up my solution by a factor of 30.
//!
//! On top of this approach we apply some high level tricks to go faster:
//! * We store previously seen pairs of `(location, keys collected)` to `total distance` in a map.
//!   If we are in the same location with the same keys but at a higher cost, then this situation
//!   can never be optimal so the solution can be discarded.
//! * When finding the distance between every pair of keys, it's faster to first only find the immediate
//!   neighbors of each key using a [Breadth first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
//!   then run the [Floyd-Warshall algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm)
//!   to construct the rest of the graph. Even though the Floyd-Warshall asymptotic bound of `O(n³)`
//!   is higher than the asymptotic bounds of repeated BFS, this was twice as fast in practice
//!   for my input.
//!
//! We also apply some low level tricks to go even faster:
//! * The set of remaining keys needed is stored as bits in an `u32`. We can have at most 26 keys
//!   so this will always fit. For example needing `a`, `b` and `e` is represented as `10011`.
//! * Robot location is also stored the same way. Robots can only ever be in their initial location
//!   or at a key, so this gives a max of 26 + 4 = 30 locations. As a nice bonus this allows
//!   part one and part two to share the same code.
//! * For fast lookup of distance between keys, the maze is stored as
//!   [adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix). `a` is index 0, `b` is
//!   index 1 and robots' initial positions are from 26 to 29 inclusive.
//!   For example (simplifying by moving robot from index 26 to 2):
//!
//!   ```none
//!       #########    [0 6 2]
//!       #b.A.@.a# => [6 0 4]
//!       #########    [2 4 0]
//!   ```
