//! # Parabolic Reflector Dish
//!
//! To solve part two we look for a cycle where the dish returns to a previously seen state.
//! By storing each dish and a index in a `HashMap` we can calculate the offset and length of the
//! cycle then use that to find to state at the billionth step.
//!
//! Calculating the state needs to be done sequentially so we use some tricks to make it as fast as
//! possible.
//!
//! First the location of each each ball is stored in a `vec`. My input had ~2,000 balls compared to
//! 10,000 grid squares total, so this approach reduces the amount of data to scan by 5x. The 2D
//! coordinates are converted so a 1D number, for example the index of a ball on the second row
//! second column would be 1 * 100 + 1 = 101.
//!
//! Next for each possible tilt orientation (north, south, east and west) an approach similar to a
//! prefix sum is used. Each edge or fixed rock is assigned an index. We expand the grid by 2 in
//! each direction (one for each edge) to handles the edges. For example, using west (left):
//!
//! ```none
//!     ..#.#..
//! ```
//!
//! is represented in `fixed_west` as (noticing the extra 0 for the left edge)
//!
//! ```none
//!     0 0 0 1 1 2 2 2
//! ```
//!
//! The number of balls that come to rest against each fixed point is counted, for example:
//!
//! ```none
//!     OO#.#OO
//! ```
//!
//! is stored in `roll_west` similar to:
//!
//! ```none
//!    2 0 2
//! ```
//!
//! This approach has two huge advantages:
//!
//! First, the number of balls resting against each fixed point completely represents the state of the
//! grid in a very compact format. For example my input has ~1600 fixed points. Using 2 bytes per
//! point needs 3.2K total to represent the grid, compared to 100 * 100 = 10K for the simple approach.
//! 3x less data is 3x faster to hash when storing states in a `HashMap` looking for duplicates.
//!
//! Second, calculating the new position of a ball is very fast. For each ball:
//!
//! * Use `fixed_*` to lookup the index in the corresponding `roll_*` vec.
//! * This stores the current index of the last ball resting against that fixed point.
//! * Increment this value by ±1 for horizontal movement or ±width for vertical movement
//!   and then update the new location of this ball.
//!
//! For example, tilting a single row west, processing each ball from left to right where each line
//! represent the new state would look like:
//!
//! ```none
//!    grid              rounded         fixed_west                       roll_west
//!    .O#..O.OO.#..O    [1 5 7 8 13]    [0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2]    [-1 2 10]
//!    O.#..O.OO.#..O    [0 5 7 8 13]    [0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2]    [0 2 10]
//!    O.#O...OO.#..O    [0 3 7 8 13]    [0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2]    [0 3 10]
//!    O.#OO...O.#..O    [0 3 4 8 13]    [0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2]    [0 4 10]
//!    O.#OOO....#..O    [0 3 4 5 13]    [0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2]    [0 5 10]
