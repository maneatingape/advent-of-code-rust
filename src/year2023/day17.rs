//! # Clumsy Crucible
//!
//! Our high level approach is an [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) search.
//! This [fantastic blog](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html)
//! is a great introduction to this algorithm.
//!
//! The heuristic is the [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry)
//! to the bottom right corner. This will never overestimate the actual distance which is an
//! essential characteristic in the heuristic.
//!
//! A crucial insight speeds things up. We only needs to store `(position, direction)` pairs in
//! the map of previously seen costs and do not also need to store the number of steps.
//! The reason is that each time we generate new states from the current state we loop over all
//! possible forward states. This implicitly means that every new state will always make a left or
//! right turn, alternating between horizontal and vertical movements.
//!
//! It's a little more subtle but we also don't need to store 4 directions but only 2, horizontal
//! and vertical. The reason is similar to not encoding the number of steps. As we are always
//! implicitly going to make a left or right turn immediately, entering a square from the opposite
//! direction is equivalent. This reduces the storage space and time by half.
//!
//! To speed things up even further we use a trick. Classic A* uses a generic priority queue that
//! can be implemented in Rust using a [`BinaryHeap`]. However the total cost follows a strictly
//! increasing order in a constrained range of values, so we can use a much faster
//! [bucket queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_queue). The maximum possible increase in
//! heuristic is 10 * 9 from heat plus 10 for the distance change for a total of 100 buckets.
