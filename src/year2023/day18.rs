//! # Lavaduct Lagoon
//!
//! Similar approach to [`Day 10`] using the [Shoelace formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula)
//! and [Pick's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick%27s_theorem).
//!
//! One nuance is that we want the number of interior *and* boundary points so the final formula is:
//!
//! `i + b => A - b / 2 + 1 + b => A + b / 2 + 1`
