//! # Hot Springs
//!
//! A [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) approach calculates
//! the possible arrangements for each entry in `O(n * w)` complexity where:
//!
//! * `n` Number of springs
//! * `w` "Wiggle" is the amount of extra free space the springs can slide around in the pattern.
//!
//! We build a table for each entry with a row for each spring and a column for every character
//! in the pattern. Adding a trailing `.` character makes bounds checking easier without changing
//! the number of arrangements. The result will be the bottom right value.
//!
//! Using the sample `?###???????? 3,2,1`:
//!
//! ```none
//!     n = 3
//!     w = 13 - (3 + 2 + 1) - 3 + 1 = 5
//!
//!          ?  #  #  #  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  .
//!       â”Œ----------------------------------------
//!     3 |  0  0  0 [0  1  1  1  1] 0  0  0  0  0
//!     2 |  0  0  0  0  0  0 [0  1  2  3  4] 0  0
//!     1 |  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 [0  1  3  6 10]
//! ```
//!
//! Each pattern updates the total at the index one *after* its end, if it can fit at that location
//! For example the first spring can only match at indices `[1, 2, 3]` so it updates the total
//! at index 4 to 1.
//!
//! The key insight is that the number of arrangements is then propagated as a prefix sum
//! from left to right for each row as long as the character at the index is not a `#` or until
//! `wiggle` characters are reached, whichever comes sooner.
//!
//! To calculate the next row, each matching pattern adds the value from the row above at the
//! index one before its start. The first row is a special case where this value is always 1.
//!
//! As a nice side effect this approach always overwrites values so we can re-use the memory buffer
//! for different entries without having to zero out values.
//!
//! ## Alternate approach
//!
//! Another way to look at the problem is to search to the left from each matching position
//! until a `#` character is found. The previous pattern can't leave any trailing `#` characters
//! otherwise it wouldn't be the previous pattern.
//!
//! Using the same example `?###???????? 3,2,1` and adding a trailing `.`:
//!
//! * `###` can only match at one location giving:
//!     ```none
//!          . # # # . . . . . . . . .
//!         [0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
//!     ````
//!
//!* The next `##` can match at 4 possible locations:
//!     ```none
//!         . # # # . # # . . . . . .
//!        [0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
//!                 <<
//!        [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
//!     ```
//! * 2nd location:
//!     ```none
//!         . # # # . . # # . . . . .
//!        [0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
//!                 <<<<
//!        [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0]
//!     ```
//! * 3rd location:
//!     ```none
//!         . # # # . . . # # . . . .
//!        [0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
//!                 <<<<<<
//!        [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0]
//!     ```
//! * 4th location:
//!     ```none
//!         . # # # . . . . # # . . .
//!        [0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
//!                 <<<<<<<<
//!        [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0]
//!     ```
//!* The final `#` can also match at 4 possible locations (for brevity only showing the 2nd pattern
//!  in a single position):
//!     ```none
//!         . # # # . # # . # . . . .
//!        [0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
//!        [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0]
//!                       <<
//!        [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0]
//!     ```
//! * 2nd location:
//!     ```none
//!         . # # # . # # . . # . . .
//!        [0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
//!        [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0]
//!                       <<<<
//!        [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0]
//!     ```
//! * 3rd location:
//!     ```none
//!         . # # # . # # . . . # . .
//!        [0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
//!        [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0]
//!                       <<<<<<
//!        [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 0 0]
//!     ```
//! * 4th location:
//!     ```none
//!         . # # # . # # . . . . # .
//!        [0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

//!        [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 4 0]
//!     ```
//!
//! The final result is then the sum of the bottom row with the nuance that any numbers before the
//! last `#` don't count as they represent an invalid pattern.
//!
//! This is equivalent to the prefix sum approach described above but a little clearer to
//! understand however slower to calculate.
