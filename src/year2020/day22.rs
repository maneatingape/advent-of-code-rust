//! # Crab Combat
//!
//! We start things off with a pun, by implementing a `Deck` of cards that is also a `Deque` or
//! [double-ended queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_queue) backed by a
//! circular buffer. Why use our own implementation when there is a perfectly good [`VecDeque`]
//! already available? The answer is speed. As there are at most fifty cards in the pack, the Deck
//! can use a fix sized stack allocated array, avoiding the expensive heap allocations that
//! [`VecDeque`] must use.
//!
//! `Deck` also keeps the score up to date as cards are added and removed, as this comes in useful
//! during part two. To update the score when a card is removed we subtract the card's value
//! multiplied by the size of the deck. For example if 5 is removed then the new
//! score is 67 - 5 * 4 = 47.
//!
//! | Deck â†“ | Weight | Score | Sum |
//! | - | - | -- | -- |
//! | 5 | 4 | 67 | 29 |
//! | 8 | 3 |    |    |
//! | 7 | 2 |    |    |
//! | 9 | 1 |    |    |
//!
//! When adding a card, it helps to have the sum of the existing cards. The new score is the old
//! score added to the new sum. For example if 6 is added to the deck:
//!
//! | Old Score | New Score | Difference |
//! | ----- | ----- | - |
//! | 5 * 4 | 5 * 5 | 5 |
//! | 8 * 3 | 8 * 4 | 8 |
//! | 7 * 2 | 7 * 3 | 7 |
//! | 9 * 1 | 9 * 2 | 9 |
//! | -     | 6 * 1 | 6 |
//! | Total: 67 | Total: 102 | Total: 35 |
//!
//! ## Part One
//!
//! The winner will always eventually be the player that starts with card 50 as they can never
//! lose this card in a round. However we need to play the full game in order to find out the
//! score of the winner's deck.
//!
//! ## Part Two
//!
//! We use two tricks to speed things up, one deterministic and one probabilistic.
//!
//! The deterministic trick is an observation that if Player 1 holds the high card in a recursive
//! game, then they will always eventually win. This comes from the fact that all cards are unique,
//! so the highest card is always greater than the size of the remaining deck, so a further
//! recursive game will never trigger when this card is played in a round. This means that Player 1
//! will never lose this card, so will either win outright or by triggering the repetition rule.
//!
//! This observation does *not* hold for Player 2. Although they can never lose the high card, they
//! could lose by the repetition rule, so the round needs to be played out in full.
//!
//! The probabilistic trick is an observation that the score makes a surprisingly good hash
//! function. Instead of storing the entire deck in the previously seen cache, we can store only
//! the combined hash of both decks, with a very good probability of no collisions.
//!
