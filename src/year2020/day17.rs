//! # Conway Cubes
//!
//! Solving this problem reveals an interesting insight that the active cells are very sparse.
//! Of the total possible volume of the cube formed by the maximum extents in part one, only
//! roughly 8% is active and of the hypercube from part two only 3% is active for my input.
//!
//! To speed things up our high level strategy will flip from a "pull" model where we check the
//! surrounding neighbors of each cell, to a "push" model where we update the neighbors of each
//! active cell instead.
//!
//! A `HashSet` is generally a good choice for very sparse infinite grids, however for this
//! problem we'll pack all dimensions into a single `vec` to achieve a five times increase
//! in lookup speed.
