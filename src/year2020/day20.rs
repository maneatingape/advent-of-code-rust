//! # Jurassic Jigsaw
//!
//! At first this seems like a daunting problem. However a little analysis shows that the input
//! has some nice properties that makes solving this more tractable.
//!
//! * Tile edges match with at most one other tile
//! * The forward and reverse tile edges form two distinct sets of 312 values with no overlap.
//!
//! Tiles can be flipped and rotated for a total of 8 possible permutations each. When parsing
//! the tiles we store all 8 edge possibilities to enable assembling the jigsaw in part two. For
//! performance we avoid transforming the inner 8x8 pixels until we have determined the
//! layout of the grid.

//!
//! ## Part One
//!
//! First we calculate the frequency of each edge, both forwards and backwards as tiles can be in
//! any orientation. As there only 2ยนโฐ or 1024 possible edge values we can use an array instead of a
//! hashtable for speed, converting the edges into a binary number to index the array.
//!
//! This results in 96 values that occur once and 528 values that occur twice. Then for every tile
//! we sum the frequency of each edge. Corner tiles will have two edges that only occur once, not
//! matching with any other tile, for a total of 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.
//!
//! Other edge tiles have a total of 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7 and inner tiles a total of 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.
//!
//! ## Part Two
//!
//! First we arbitrarily pick any corner tile that is oriented so that its unique edges are facing
//! top and left. Then we proceed row by row, looking up the next tile to the right. Each time
//! we find a tile we remove it from the remaining tiles, so that looking up a tile is always a
//! very fast constant time `O(1)` operation.
//!
//! The complete picture is stored as an array of `u128` values as the tiles form a square 12 wide,
//! for a total of 12 * 8 = 96 pixels. As we add each tile, we convert its pixels into a `u8` binary
//! number and left shift to add to the existing pixels.
//!
//! When finding the monsters we make some further assumptions about the input:
//!
//! * The monsters will all be oriented the same way
//! * Monsters will not overlap with each other
//!
//! For speed the monster bit patterns are rotated and flipped instead of the image, then stored
//! in hardcoded arrays. The search ends as soon as we find monsters in any orientation.
