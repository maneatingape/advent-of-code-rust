//! # Custom Customs
//!
//! This is a disguised binary question like the previous [`day 5`].
//!
//! We can store each passenger's answers as an implicit set in a `u32` since the cardinality
//! is only 26. For each yes answer we set a bit, shifting left based on the letter. For example
//! `acf` would be represented as `100101`.
//!
//! For part one to find groups where any person answered yes, we reduce the group using
//! [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation) then count the number of ones
//! for each group using the blazing fast [`count_ones`] intrinsic.
//!
//! Part two is very similar, except that we use a bitwise AND instead.
//!
//! [`day 5`]: crate::year2020::day05
//! [`count_ones`]: u32::count_ones
