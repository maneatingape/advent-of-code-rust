//! # Report Repair
//!
//! The straightforward approach is to compare every possible pair of elements for part one and
//! every possible triple for part two. This would have `O(n²)` and `O(n³)`time complexity respectively.
//!
//! We can do better with `O(n)` complexity for part one and `O(n²)` for part two.
//!
//! For part one we use an implicit hash table in an array, since values are constrained to between
//! 0 and 2020 and each value is already perfectly hashed. For each entry we check the index
//! at its value. If this is marked then we have seen the reciprocal `2020 - value` before
//! so we can return the product. If not then we mark the reciprocal value in the array.
//!
//! Part 2 reuses the pair finding logic, finding the third element by stepping through the slice
//! one by one and adjusting the target total. To reuse the array without reallocating
//! (which is slow) we use a `round` value instead of `bool`.
