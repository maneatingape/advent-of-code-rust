//! # Rucksack Reorganization
//!
//! The core idea of this puzzle is computing set intersection. We could use the built-in `HashSet`
//! but as the cardinality of the set is so small (52 maximum including both lowercase and upper
//! case letters) we can instead use a much faster approach of storing each set in a single `u128`
//! integer and using bit manipulation.
//!
//! If a letter is present in the set then the corresponding bit will be `1` otherwise `0`.
//! For example to add the letter "a", logical OR the set with 1 shifted left by 97
//!
//! `set | (1 << 97)`
//!
//! Set intersection is the logical AND of two integers which compiles to a single machine instruction.
//!
//! `a & b`
//!
//! To obtain the score we can use the [`trailing_zeroes`] method to find the first set bit. On most
//! architectures this also compiles down to a single instruction (`LZCNT` on x86 or `CLZ` on ARM)
//! that is blazing fast.
//!
//! Notes:
//! * We could get away with a `u64` for the set, but by using an `u128` we can shift directly by the
//!   raw ASCII codes and not bother computing offsets until the very end.
//!
//! [`trailing_zeroes`]: u128
