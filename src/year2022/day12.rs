//! # Hill Climbing Algorithm
//!
//! Pretty much textbook implementation of a BFS (Breadth First Search). If you're not familiar with
//! BFS, [this blog post is a great introduction](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html)
//! to the algorithm, plus some others that come in handy for Advent of Code.
//!
//! Implementation notes:
//! * A [`VecDeque`] of [`Point`] is used to store the frontier as it gives better performance
//!   than [`vec`] when used as a FIFO queue.
//! * [`Grid`] is used to store both the height information and visited nodes.
//!
//! For Part 2 we could search for all `a` locations and repeatedly start a BFS search from there,
//! then find the lowest value. However a much faster approach is to search *backwards* from the
//! end location. Due to the fact that BFS always explores closest nodes first this will find the
//! closest `a` location in a single search. For part 1 it will have the same result, so we
//! can re-use the same code.
//!

//! [`Point`]: crate::util::point
