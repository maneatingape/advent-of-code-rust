//! # Pyroclastic Flow
//!
//! ## Part One
//!
//! For speed we encode each rock shape as binary bits so that we can use bitwise logic to check
//! for collisions. Each rock is encoded top to bottom and left to right. For example:
//!
//! ```none
//!    #     00010000    0x10
//!   ### => 00111000 => 0x38 => 0x00103810
//!    #     00010000    0x10
//! ```
//!
//! The bits are shifted 2 away from the left wall. Walls are also encoded in binary, overlapping
//! the left and right walls (no rock will ever collide first with a wall and its top row):
//!
//! ```none
//!   100000001
//!   100000001 => 0x01010101
//!   100000001
//! ```
//!
//! We store the accumulated tower efficiently as a vec of `u8` including the floor at index
//! zero as a special pattern of `11111111`.
//!
//! We use bitwise AND to check for collisions between the rock, the walls and the existing tower
//! in one operation.
//!
//! ## Part Two
//!
//! Since there's no reasonable way to analytically predict the height after some `n` rocks
//! and brute force would take too long we can assume that there must be a
//! [cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_(graph_theory)) in the output.
//!
//! We choose an arbitrary length and generate a sequence of that size then search
//! for repeating patterns. Once we find the length of the cycle then we can extrapolate for
//! any `n` greater than the start of the cycle.
