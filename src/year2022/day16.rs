//! ## Parsing
//!
//! First we simplify the graph formed by the valves. With the exception of `AA` there's no need to
//! stop at any zero valve, so we're only interested in the distance between non-zero valves.
//! This significantly reduces the complexity of the solution space as there are only around
//! 15 non-zero valves versus around 60 valves total.
//!
//! For each valve we find the distance to its immediate non-zero neighbors. Then we use the
//! [Floyd Warshall algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm) to
//! find the distance between any two non-zero valves, storing this information in an
//! [adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix) for fast lookup.
//!
//! ## Part One
//!
//! The approach is [branch and bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound) enumerating
//! every possible combination combined with a heuristic to prune those combinations in order to
//! achieve a reasonable running time.
//!
//! The heuristic assumes that we can visit all remaining valves in descending order of flow,
//! taking only the minimum possible time to reach each valve. As this will always be better
//! than the actual maximum possible we can immediately prune any branch that would still be less
//! than the current high score.
//!
//! ## Part Two
//!
//! Part two uses an ingenious approach from [@korreman](https://github.com/korreman/aoc2022).
//!
//! First calculate the maximum value for any possible combination of valves reachable in
//! 26 minutes by a single entity. Then calculate a second score from the remaining unopened
//! valves.
//!
//! The neat part is using this second score as the heuristic threshold for a search over all
//! possible valve combinations. This works as the sum of the first two searches provides a
//! minimum baseline. If a branch can't do better then it can be pruned.
//!
//! Then we check every possible pair formed by those values, considering only the pairs
//! where the sets of valves are [disjoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_sets),
//! which is when you and the elephant have visited different sets of valves.
