//! # Camp Cleanup
//!
//! This puzzle asks to compute range intersections. To simplify the 2nd part, we can use a trick.
//! Rather than consider each possible case of intersection (overlapping start, overlapping end,
//! completely enclosed or completely enclosing) it's simpler to check if two ranges *don't* overlap
//! then invert.
//!
//! If `a` and `b` are the ordered start and end of the first range and `c` and `d` the ordered
//! start and end of the second range, then if:
//!
//! `a > d || c > b`
//!
//! the 2 ranges can't overlap. Using [DeMorgan's laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws)
//! this can be inverted to:
//!
//! `a <= d && c <= b`
//!
//! to check when two ranges do overlap.
