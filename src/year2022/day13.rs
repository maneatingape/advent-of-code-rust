//! # Distress Signal

//! One possible approach is to parse the input into a tree, then compare recursively node
//! by node. We're going to use a much faster and simpler approach by noting an observation about
//! the input data. If the sequence `10` is replaced by any single character greater than `9` then
//! we can compare the 2 packets *lexicographically*. We'll replace all occurrences of `10` with `A`
//! then compare packets character by character.
//!
//! The rules to compare 2 packets become:
//! * If both characters are the same then it's a draw, move onto the next character in each packet.
//! * If the first packet is `]` and the second packet anything else, then the first list is shorter
//!   so the packets are in order.
//! * Conversely if the second packet is `]` and the first packet anything else, the packets are not
//!   in order.
//! * If the first packet is an opening `[` and the second character anything else, then we're
//!   comparing a number with a list, so *push* the second character back onto the list to check
//!   again along with a closing `]` character.
//! * Do a similar push if the second character is an opening `[` and the first anything else.
//! * Finally compare the 2 characters by value. Since we've already covered the equal case, one
//!   is guaranteed to be greater or less than the other.
