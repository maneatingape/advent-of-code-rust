//! While [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) may feel like a
//! natural choice, it's much faster and easier to simply treat the input as a single stream of raw
//! ASCII `u8` bytes without splitting line by line.
//!
//! For part one we skip over the first quote of each line. The last quote on each line increases
//! the difference by two since every line is enclosed with two quotes. If we encounter a
//! hexadecimal escape then four characters become one so the difference increases by three.
//! The sequences `\\` and `\"` both increase the difference by one.
//!
//! Part two is even more straightforward. Quotes and backslashes need to be escaped so increase
//! the difference by one. Each newline increases by the difference by two.
