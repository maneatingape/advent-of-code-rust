//! # A Regular Map
//!
//! Simple solution taking advantage of a controversial property of the input. After taking any
//! branch it's assumed that we can return to the pre-branch position. This does *not* hold for
//! general inputs, as it's easy to construct paths which violate this constraint.
//!
//! We use a stack to save the position before a branch, pushing whenever an opening `(` is
//! encountered then popping whenever the closing `)` is found. Additionally we assume that
//! the location will never move more than 55 rooms from the starting location in order to use
//! a fixed size array to hold the minimum distance to any room.
