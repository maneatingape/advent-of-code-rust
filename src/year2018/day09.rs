//! # Marble Mania
//!
//! Efficient solution using an append only `vec` and generating only the minimum number of marbles
//! needed to play the game.
//!
//! First let's consider some other slower approaches:
//!
//! We could store marbles in a `vec`, inserting and removing elements to make room. Each of these
//! operations takes `O(n)` complexity. For part two if number of marbles is 100,000 then the
//! total complexity is `100,000 * 100 * 100,000 = 10¹²` which is infeasible.
//!
//! A better approach is a linked list. Insert and remove operations are now `O(1)` for a total
//! part two complexity of `100,000 * 1 * 100  = 10⁷`. This is slow but practical. However linked
//! lists have a number of drawbacks:
//!
//! 1. Poor cache locality
//! 2. Allocation per element
//! 3. Ownership issues complex enough to inspire an entire
//!    [blog post series](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/).
//!
//! ## First optimization
//!
//! The first key insight is that we can generate the marble sequence by only appending to a `vec`.
//! We keep track of the head `()` and tail `<>` of the circle. Each turn adds two marbles to the
//! head and removes one from the tail, growing the circle by one each time.
//! For example the first 4 marbles look like:
//!
//! ```none
//!    <0>
//!     0  <0> (1)
//!     0   0  <1>  0  (2)
//!     0   0   1  <0>  2  1  (3)
//!     0   0   1   0  <2>  1  3  0  (4)
//! ```
//!
//! Things start to get interesting at the 19th marble. When we pick the 23rd marble this will
//! be 7 places counter clockwise, so we can optimize by not adding it at all to the circle.
//! Instead we save the value for later.
//!
//! ```none
//!     18th marble
//!     ...<9>  2  10   5  11   1  12   6  13   3  14   7  15   0  16   8  17   4  (18)
//!
//!     19th marble, saving value of previous tail 9.
//!     ...<2> 10   5  11   1  12   6  13   3  14   7  15   0  16   8  17   4  18  (19)
//! ```
//!
//! For the 20th, 21st and 22nd marbles we re-write the history of the tail then move it backwards.
//!
//! ```none
//!     20th marble
//!     ... 2  20   9  <2> 10   5  11   1  12   6  13   3  14   7  15   0  16   8  17   4  18  (19)
//!         ^  ^^
//!
//!     21st marble
//!     ... 2  20  10 <21> 10   5  11   1  12   6  13   3  14   7  15   0  16   8  17   4  18  (19)
//!                ^^  ^^
//!
//!     22nd marble (move tail)
//!     ...<2> 20  10  21   5  22  11   1  12   6  13   3  14   7  15   0  16   8  17   4  18  (19)
//!                         ^  ^^
//! ```
//!
//! The 23rd marble is never added to the circle instead increasing the current player's score.
//! The cycle then begins again, handling the next 18 marbles normally, then the next 19th to 22nd
//! marbles specially.
//!
//! ## Second optimization
//!
//! It may seem that we need to generate `(last marble / 23)` blocks. However in each block we add
//! 37 marbles (2 each for the first 18 marbles and 1 for the 19th) while the marble added to each
//! player's score advances `23 - 7 = 16` marbles. This means we only need to generate about
//!  `16/37` or `44%` of the total blocks to solve the game deterministcally. This saves both
//! processing time and memory storage proportionally.
