//! # Mode Maze
//!
//! Our high level approach is an [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) search.
//! This [fantastic blog](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html)
//! is a great introduction to this algorithm. The heuristic is the
//! [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) to the target. This will
//! never overestimate the actual distance which is an essential characteristic in the heuristic.
//! Interestingly benchmarking showed that adding the time to switch tools if we don't have the
//! torch to the heuristic slowed things down.
//!
//! Using A* instead of [Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) results
//! in a 6x speedup. This is because Dijkstra explores the grid evenly in both axes, so if the
//! target is 700 deep, then we will explore an area roughly 700 x 700 in size. In contrast A*
//! prefers reducing the distance to the target, exploring a more narrow area
//! approximately 130 x 700 in size. The state is a tuple of `(location, tool)` in order to track
//! the time per tool separately.
//!
//! To speed things up even further we use a trick. Classic A* uses a generic priority queue that
//! can be implemented in Rust using a [`BinaryHeap`]. However the total cost follows a strictly
//! increasing order in a constrained range of values, so we can use a much faster
//! [bucket queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_queue). The range of the increase is from
//! 0 (moving toward the target and not changing tools) to 7 (staying put and changing tools)
//! requiring 8 buckets total.
