//! # Alchemical Reduction
//!
//! ## Part One
//!
//! This problem is similar to checking if a parentheses expression is balanced or not.
//! We use a similar approach, maintaining a stack of unreacted polymer units. Each unit from the
//! polymer is compared to the head of the stack using bitwise logic. Lowercase and uppercase ASCII
//! codes for the same letter are always are 32 apart, which can be checked very quickly using
//! bitwise XOR. For example:
//!
//! ```none
//!         A = 65 = 01000001
//!         a = 97 = 01100001
//!     A ^ a = 32 = 00100000
//! ```
//!
//! If two units are the same type but opposite polarity then they are popped from the stack.
//!
//! ## Part Two
//!
//! An important optimization is to use the already reacted polymer from part one. This is
//! approximately 20% of the size of the raw input. Then this smaller polymer is filtered
//! further for each of the 26 kinds of unit.
