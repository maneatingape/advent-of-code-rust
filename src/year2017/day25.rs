//! # The Halting Problem
//!
//! The input is parsed into a 2 dimensional array covering each possible combination of state
//! and tape value at the cursor. Each transition is then computed via a lookup into this array.
//!
//! To speed things up by about ten times, multiple transitions are then precomputed to allow
//! skipping forward multiple steps at a time.
//!
//! For each of the 6 * 256 = 1536 combinations of a tape with 4 values to the left and 3 values
//! to the right of the cursor, the turing machine is computed one steps at a time until the cursor
//! leaves the area to the left or to the right. For example:
//!
//! ```none
//!     State: A            => State: B
//!       1 0 1 0 [1] 0 0 1     [0] 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
//!
//!     State: B
//!       t t t t [0] 0 1 0
//! ```
//!
//! In this example the tape then advances four bits to the left, loading the four values of `t`
//! then the next batch lookup is performed.
