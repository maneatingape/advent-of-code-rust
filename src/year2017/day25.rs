//! # The Halting Problem
//!
//! The input is parsed into a 2 dimensional array covering each possible combination of state
//! and tape value at the cursor. Each transition is then computed via a lookup into this array.
//!
//! To speed things up by about ten times, multiple transitions are then precomputed to allow
//! skipping forward multiple steps at a time. Blocks 128 cells wide are cached once the cursor
//! moves off either end.
//!
//! Interestingly the total number of distinct cached blocks is very low, approximately 200.
//! The cursor also doesn't move too far, only covering a range of about 6,000 steps.
