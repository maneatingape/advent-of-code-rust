//! # Packet Scanners
//!
//! This problem is similar to [`Year 2016 Day 15`]. However the key difference is that we need
//! to *avoid* the scanners, so the [Chinese Remainder Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem)
//! is not applicable.
//!
//! Part one checks that we can calculate the period for each scanner which is `2 * (range - 1)`.
//! For example a scanner with range 3 will be at the top position at time 0, 4, 8 and so on.
//!
//! To avoid a brute force approach for part two we sieve possible values for each scanner
//! sorted in ascending order of period. To combine the previous sieved values with the next
//! scanner, we find the [least common multiple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple)
//! of their ranges. Then we "stretch" the sieved values to cover the new range, by adding
//! multiples of the factor between the previous range and the new lcm. Finally any values
//! that would collide with the new scanner are filtered out.
//!
//! Using the sample data:
//!
//! ```none
//!    0: 3       1  2
//!    1: 2  =>   0  4
//!    4: 4       4  6
//!    6: 4       6  6
//! ```
//!
//! Starting value is `[1]`. First scanner:
//!
//! * Lcm of 1 and 2 => 2
//! * Stretch `[1] => [1+0 1+1] => [1 2]`
//! * Filter `[1 2] => [2]`
//!
//! Second scanner:
//!
//! * Lcm of 2 and 4 => 4
//! * Stretch `[2] => [2+0 2+2] => [2 4]`
//! * Filter `[2 4] => [2]`
//!
//! Third scanner:
//!
//! * Lcm of 4 and 6 => 12
//! * Stretch `[2] => [2+0 2+4 2+8] => [2 6 10]`
//! * Filter `[2 6 10] => [6 10]`
//!
//! Fourth scanner:
//!
//! * Lcm of 12 and 6 => 12
//! * Stretch `[6 10] => [6+0 10+0] => [6 10]`
//! * Filter `[6 10] => [10]`
//!
//! The lowest remaining value is our answer `10`.
