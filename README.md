# Advent of Code [![checks-badge]][checks-link] [![docs-badge]][docs-link]

Complete 2024 to 2015 entries written in Rust for the annual [Advent of Code] challenge,
solving 500 stars in less than 1 second.

## Features

* Each solution uses the most efficient algorithms to the best of my knowledge.
* Self contained depending only on the `std` Rust library. No use of `unsafe` features.
* Consistently formatted with `rustfmt` and linted by `clippy`.
* Thoroughly commented with `rustdoc` generated [documentation online][docs-link].
* Test coverage with continuous integration provided by [GitHub Actions][checks-link].

## Quickstart

<details>
<summary>Show details</summary><p/>

**Input**

Place input files in `input/yearYYYY/dayDD.txt` including leading zeroes. For example:
* `input/year2015/day23.txt`
* `input/year2023/day02.txt`

**Run**
* Everything `cargo run`
* Specific year `cargo run year2023`
* Specific day `cargo run year2023::day01`
* Release profile (faster) `cargo run --release`
* Optimized for current CPU architecture (fastest) `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo run --release`

**Test**
* Everything `cargo test`
* Specific year `cargo test year2023`
* Specific day `cargo test year2023::day01`
* Show STDOUT for debugging `cargo test -- --nocapture`

**Benchmark**
* Everything `cargo bench`
* Specific year `cargo bench year2023`
* Specific day `cargo bench year2023::day01`

**Document**
* Build docs including private items `cargo doc --document-private-items`
* Build doc then open HTML landing page `cargo doc --document-private-items --open`

**Miscellaneous**
* Code quality lints `cargo clippy`
* Consistent code formatting `cargo fmt`

## Contributing

Improvements to solutions are always appreciated. Please see the
[detailed instructions](CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to get started.

## Performance

Benchmarks are measured using the built-in `cargo bench` tool run on an [Apple M2 Max][apple-link].
All 250 solutions from 2024 to 2015 complete sequentially in **580 milliseconds**.
Interestingly 84% of the total time is spent on just 9 solutions.
Performance is reasonable even on older hardware, for example a 2011 MacBook Pro with an
[Intel i7-2720QM][intel-link] processor takes 3.5 seconds to run the same 250 solutions.
